                <p>VKellogg’s is a multinational company renowned for its production of breakfast foods and snacks. Founded by Will Keith Kellogg in 1906, the company is headquartered in Battle Creek, Michigan, United States. VKellogg's is well-known as one of the major cereal manufacturers worldwide and boasts a long history of food product innovation. Our mission is to provide you and your family better breakfasts that lead to better days, the same way W.K. Kellogg did back in 1898.</p>
                <p>We serve consumers with a wide range of cereals which are made with staple grains like wheat, corn, and rice. Our cereals fulfil the diverse nutrition needs of different members in the family, be it the home-maker, growing children or adults on the go. In 1996, we launched VKellogg’s Chocos, a product meant to specifically cater to the nutritional needs of growing children. In 1999, we took our cause further when we launched Project Red Alert- fortifying VKellogg’s Corn Flakes with iron to address the problems of iron deficiency in children. Then, in 2008, we took yet another leap forward by launching INR 10/- SKUs with a vision to make nutrition affordable and easily accessible to India. In 2014, we added to our snacking portfolio by bringing the much loved Pringles chips to India.</p>
                <p>In 2020, we expanded our portfolio by launching our first-ever Indian breakfast product VKellogg Upma, followed by targeting the ‘In-between meal’ segment for our 3 p.m snacking needs with K-energy Bars. With the launch of our globally loved and fastest growing brand VKellogg’s Froot Loops in 2021, we unlocked food that delights all senses!</p>
